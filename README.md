# Moana TD Sensor Sample Plots

Samples of some key plots used by the Moana Project's Mang≈çpare Temperature Sensor Programme, including a map showing the average number of sensor deployments per day in the Aotearoa New Zealand region and a bar chat showing total number of observations by month.  Currently, there is only a jupyter notebook, but hopefully soon the code will be available as a short library.

For the Aotearoa New Zealand region, a Zenodo reference to the data can be found here:
