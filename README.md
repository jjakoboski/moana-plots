# Moana TD Sensor Sample Plots

This is a fork of [moana-plots](https://github.com/metocean/moana-plots), which contains "samples of some key plots used by the Moana Project's Mangōpare Temperature Sensor Programme, including a map showing the average number of sensor deployments per day in the Aotearoa New Zealand region and a bar chat showing total number of observations by month."  

This fork includes a very simple sqlite database that contains some/most of the Mangōpare data and associated code to create the database.  Please don't rely on this as an operational database containing everything that is publicly available, as it is and does not, unless you deploy it as such.

For the Aotearoa New Zealand region, a Zenodo reference to the data can be found here:
